# Infrastructure

Sonic's infrastructure is similar to Solana in many ways. So this section should be easy to understand if you are already familiar with Solana. If you would like to learn more about Solana's infrastructure, you may learn more about it [here](https://solana.com/docs#understanding-the-architecture).

Sonic's architecture is comprised of:

* **Clusters** - a collection of validators that work together for consensus
* **Validators** - the individual nodes that are the backbone of the network.&#x20;
